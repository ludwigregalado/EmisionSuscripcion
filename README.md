# EmisionSuscripcion

The goal of this project was to estimate the waiting times that an insurance company's customers should wait to be assisted once they issued a request order.


In order to do this, the data were queried from a Microsoft SQL server (script not available due to security reasons). After that, an exploratory analysis were performed with R and PMTk (Process Mining Toolkit from Fraunhofer Institute).

Once the Customer service team reviwed the general statistical analysis, the prediction were performed with pymc on a jupyter notebook.
